# Alerter

alerter is a command-line tool to send Mac OS X User Alerts (Notifications),
which are available in Mac OS X 10.8 and higher.
the program ends when the alerter is activated or closed, writing a the activated value to output (stdout), or a json object to describe the alert event.

Alerts are osx notifications that stay on screen unless dismissed.

2 kinds of alert notification can be triggered : "Reply Alert" or "Actions Alert"

## Reply alert
Open a notification in the top-right corner of your screen and display a "Reply" button, which opens a text input. 

## Actions alert
Open a notification in the top-right corner of your screen and display one or more actions to click on.

# Features
* set alert's icon, title, subtitle, image.
* capture text typed by user in the reply type alert.
* timeout : automatically close the alert notification after a delay.
* change the close button label.
* change the actions dropdown label.
* play a sound while delivering the alert notification.
* value or json output on alert's event (closed, timeout, replied, activated...) 
* close the alert notification on SIGINT, SIGTERM.

## Options

At a minimum, you have to specify either the `-message` , the `-remove`
or the `-list` option.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`-message VALUE`  **[required]**

The message body of the notification.

Note that if this option is omitted and data is piped to the application, that
data will be used instead.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`-reply`

The notification will be displayed as a reply type alert.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`-actions VALUE1,VALUE2,"VALUE 3"`

The notification actions avalaible.
When you provide more than one value, a dropdown will be displayed.
You can customize this dropdown label with the next option
Does not work when -reply is used

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`-dropdownLabel VALUE`

The notification actions dropdown title (only when multiples -actions values are provided).
Does not work when -reply is used

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`-closeLabel VALUE`

The notification "Close" button label.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`-title VALUE`

The title of the notification. This defaults to ‘Terminal’.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`-subtitle VALUE`

The subtitle of the notification.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`-timeout NUMBER`

Auto close the alert notification after NUMBER seconds.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`-sound NAME`

The name of a sound to play when the notification appears. The names are listed
in Sound Preferences. Use 'default' for the default notification sound.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`-json`

Alerter will output a json struct to describe what happened to the alert.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`-group ID`

Specifies the ‘group’ a notification belongs to. For any ‘group’ only _one_
notification will ever be shown, replacing previously posted notifications.

A notification can be explicitely removed with the `-remove` option, describe
below.

Examples are:

* The sender’s name to scope the notifications by tool.
* The sender’s process ID to scope the notifications by a unique process.
* The current working directory to scope notifications by project.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`-remove ID`  **[required]**

Removes a notification that was previously sent with the specified ‘group’ ID,
if one exists. If used with the special group "ALL", all message are removed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`-list ID` **[required]**

Lists details about the specified ‘group’ ID. If used with the special group
"ALL", details about all currently active  messages are displayed.

The output of this command is a json array of alert notifications.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`-sender ID`

Specifying this will make it appear as if the notification was send by that
application instead, including using its icon.

Using this option fakes the sender application, so that the notification system
will launch that application when the notification is clicked. Because of this
it is important to note that you cannot combine this with options like
`-execute`, `-open`, and `-activate` which depend on the sender of the
notification to be ‘alerter’ to perform its work.

For information on the `ID` see the `-activate` option.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`-appIcon PATH` **[10.9+ only]**

Specifies The PATH or URL of an image to display instead of the application icon.

**WARNING: This option is subject to change since it relies on a private method.**

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`-contentImage PATH` **[10.9+ only]**

Specifies The PATH or URL of an image to display attached inside the notification.

**WARNING: This option is subject to change since it relies on a private method.**

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    **) echo "? --> $ANSWER" ;;
